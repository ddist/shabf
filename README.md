# Multithreaded SHA256 Brute Forcer

Breaks SHA256 encryption through brute force. Uses the thread pool model to distribute workload to *n* threads. 

The thread pool library used was recycled from [here](https://github.com/ddist/pso_multithread).

### Requirements

- GCC 4.8+
- Some Linux OS
- POSIX threads support
